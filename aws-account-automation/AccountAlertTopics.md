# AccountAlertTopics

This template creates three SNS topics in your account for Critical, Error and Info Alerts. It can additionally deploy a Lambda to send messages to a Slack Webhook (stored in Secrets Manager).

The three SNS Topic are exported from this template and can be leveraged with the ImportValue feature in cloudformation. Those exports are:
* SNSAlertsCriticalArn
* SNSAlertsErrorArn
* SNSAlertsInfoArn

You must specifiy an email and SMS number. The email will be subscribed to all three topics, and the SMS number will be subscribed to the Critical Topic
